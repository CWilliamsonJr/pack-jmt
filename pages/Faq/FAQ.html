  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <dl id="faq" style="margin: 0px auto;">
    <dt>What are the advantages of a survey?</dt>
      <dd><p>With a survey you will be able to access the opinions of a large amount of people
        in a short amount of time.  With the right questions, you will be well on your way
        to understanding how to move forward.  In short, surveys are the most efficient
        way to gather information, whether that be in a small group setting, or in
        a large market setting.</p></dd>
        <dt>Why should we choose to work with you?</dt>
        <dd><p>Not only are our prices competitive, but we have formed relationships with businesses
          around the world, giving you access to a larger pool of respondents.  This can be accomplished
          through internet marketing or through email.  In addition, we offer a large range of
          customization options, which allows you to make your survey more appealing.</dd>
  	<dt>Is there a limit to the number of people who can take the survey?</p></dt>
		<dd><p>There is not a limit, but prices may vary depending on the number of
				respondents you wish to take the survey.  For example, sending a survey out to ten people
				costs less than sending surveys out to one hundred people.  For more information about
				pricing you can call and we will give you pricing plans and options.  In addition, you
				can cap the number of respondents if you wish, so that your data pool doesn't grow larger
				than you intended.</p></dd>
	<dt>How much does sending out a survey cost?</dt>
		<dd><p>The price of sending out a survey varies with the number of surveys you wish to send out.
			We have a free program you can join, but it is limited to 25 people at a time.  If you wish to send
			out more surveys, the price scales up not only as a result of the number of surveys sent out, but also
			as a result of the number of questions and the extent to which the survey is customized.  For example, sending
			out 500 blank surveys with only three questions may cost less than sending out 300 surveys with 10 questions that
			are heavily customized.</p></dd>
	<dt>Is there a limit to the number of questions per survey?</dt>
		<dd><p>There is not a limit, but the number of questions per survey not only affects price, it may effect
			the number of responses.  We suggest limiting the number of questions to 25 for small group surveys,
			and furthur limiting the number of questions to 10 for mass surveys.  That way, while you may not
			get all of your answers, you will get the responses you need.  If you need to send out another survey
			to get all of your answers, you will still be able to get high quality responses.</p></dd>
    <dt>What kind of questions can be put on the survey?</dt>
		<dd><p>You can put three kinds of questions on your survey: true/false, multiple choice, and short answer.
      The only caveat is that if you put short answer on your survey, we will not be able to give the same
      type of analysis we coul provide if you only asked true/false and multiple choice questions.</p></dd>
    <dt>When will I get the results?</dt>
		<dd><p>As soon as people respond to your survey, you will get the results.  Once
		everybody has responded, you will get an overview of the responses.  This overview can
  		be modified depending on your needs.  It can be a simple bar graph or it can be
  		a pie chart or a myriad of other options.</p></dd>
    <dt>Can I customize my survey?</dt>
       <dd><p>We offer customization options for the presentation of the survey as well
        as presentation of the results.  For different presentation options please call.
  	  However, we have found that oftentimes a simple survey works as well, or better, than
  	  a complicated one because people are more likely to see the survey as quick and easy.
  	  As for the presentation options, we offer customizable options, but it is also easy to
  	  create your own presentation with just the data.</p></dd>
    <dt>How do I send out my survey?</dt>
      <dd><p>You can send out your survey via email or social media.  Once the survey
        is created, it will be sent to the addresses and profiles that
        you specify.  However, if you wish to send out a mass survey, you must provide
		the social media outlets that you want the surveys posted on.  For example, you can post
		the survey on your twitter account and/or your facebook page.</p></dd>
    <dt>Can I send out a mass survey to a target audience?</dt>
      <dd>  <p>Yes, we will help you find your target demographic, and allow you
         to send out a mass survey, or put it on websites for people to
         fill out.  Given the demographic that you are wishing to target, we
     will use different outlets.  We have done market research to determine
     which websites different demographics visit.<p></dd>
